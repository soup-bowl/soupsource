# Soupsource
Run a simple PHP site with markdown files, no database needed. Simply store the
markdown files in the pages folder in the structure you want, and it will take
it from there. No administration page needed!

## Pre-alpha!
The direction this will take is still being decided, and is pre-alpha. Please
bear that in mind before using this software.

If you want a fully functioning Markdown-run CMS, I recommended checking out
[Pico](http://picocms.org/).
